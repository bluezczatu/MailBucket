An npm library that aggregates multiple APIs for creating and receiving temporary/disposable emails through a unified interface.

## ðŸ¤” Why?

Working directly with various temporary email service APIs can be cumbersome. Each has its own authentication method, endpoints, and response structure. This library aims to provide a single, consistent way to interact with multiple providers, simplifying the process of generating temporary emails and fetching messages programmatically.

## âœ¨ Features

*   Unified API for multiple temp email providers.
*   Create new temporary email accounts/addresses.
*   Fetch incoming messages for an address.
*   List available domains (per provider).
*   Delete accounts (where supported by the provider API).
*   TypeScript support (optional, but recommended).

## âœ… Supported Providers

This library currently supports the following temporary email service APIs:

*   [mail.tm](https://mail.tm)
*   [mail.gw](https://mail.gw)
*   [emailnator.com](https://emailnator.com)

*Note: Provider availability and API stability depend on the external services themselves.*

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

```bash
npm install mailbucket
# or
pnpm install mailbucket
